Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Use of appropriate data structure enables a computer system to perform its task more efficiently,
by influencing the ability of computer to store and retrieve data from any location in its memory.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. The possible operations on the linear data structure are: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting and Merging.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Compiler Design.
   Operating System.
   Database Management System.
   Statistical analysis package.
   Numerical Analysis.
   Graphics.
   Artificial Intelligence, and Simulation.

what is an Array?
A. An array is a collection of one or more values of the same type. Each value is called an element of the array.
 The elements of the array share the same variable name but each element has its own unique index number


what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. Array and ArrayList in Java is that Array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.
 You can not store primitives in ArrayList, it can only contain Objects. While Array can contain both primitives and Objects in Java.


what is LinkedList?
A. Linked List are linear data structures where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.


How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index.
 Linked list relies on references where each node consists of the data and the references to the previous and next element.

what is queue?
A. Queue is an abstract data structure, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue)
and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology.


what is stack?
A. A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
 A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top.


what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. This is also referred to as the "Last In First Out (LIFO)" principle. In contrast, a Java Queue uses a "First In First Out (FIFO)" principle,
where elements are added to the end of the queue, and removed from the beginning of the queue.

what is the order of complexity?
A. This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it.
 Generally, the smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm, the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger.


what is the best case to search an element from an array?

A. // Java implementation to search an element in
   // the unsorted array using minimum number of
   // comparisons
   import java.io.*;

   class GFG {

       // Function to search an element in
       // minimum number of comparisons
       static String search(int arr[], int n, int x)
       {
           // 1st comparison
           if (arr[n - 1] == x)
               return "Found";

           int backup = arr[n - 1];
           arr[n - 1] = x;

           // no termination condition and thus
           // no comparison
           for (int i = 0;; i++) {
               // this would be executed at-most n times
               // and therefore at-most n comparisons
               if (arr[i] == x) {
                   // replace arr[n-1] with its actual element
                   // as in original 'arr[]'
                   arr[n - 1] = backup;

                   // if 'x' is found before the '(n-1)th'
                   // index, then it is present in the array
                   // final comparison
                   if (i < n - 1)
                       return "Found";

                   // else not present in the array
                   return "Not Found";
               }
           }
       }



what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. The worst case complexity is O(n/2) (equivalent to O(n)) when element is in the middle or not present in the array.
The best case complexity is O(1) when element is first or last element in the array



what is tree in data structure?
A. Tree is a hierarchical data structure which stores the information naturally in the form of hierarchy style.
 Tree is one of the most powerful and advanced data structures.

what is graph in data structure?
A.  A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.


what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. There are several differences between HashMap and Hashtable in Java: Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not.
 This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.



What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
   Network data model = Graph
   Hierarchical data model = Trees


How HashMap works in java?
A. HashMap in Java works on hashing principle. ... HashMap internally stores mapping in the form of Map.
Entry object which contains both key and value object. When you want to retrieve the object, you call the get() method and again pass the key object.


What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index.
This exception is thrown when the index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. Manually.
   Arrays.copyOf()
   System.arraycopy()
   Object.clone()


What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. Array is a collection of elements of similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of same type,
which are connected to each other using pointers.



What is DFS and BFS?
A. DFS stands for Depth First Search. BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path.
 BFS can be used to find single source shortest path in an unweighted graph,


What is Recursion?
A. Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. linear and non linear data structures is that linear data structures arrange data in a sequential manner while
nonlinear data structures arrange data in a hierarchical manner, creating a relationship among the data elements.


What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
